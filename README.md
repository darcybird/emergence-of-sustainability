For convenience's sake, we'll all be using GITKRAKEN to organize our data.

When you work on a new task, make a new branch using the Branches Button in the top bar of gitkraken. Enter descriptive name.
  1. Code whatever you want.
  2. Make sure you're on the correct branch
  3. Pull
  4. stage changes
  5. commit
  6. Push
  7. Continue working. <br>
      a. Anyone who wants to work on your task can open your branch. Do this by clicking the branch you want, right click, and select "Checkout origin/<branch-name>" <br>
      b. Continue pushing/pulling on that branch until you want to move on. Then you can switch branches by selecting the dropdown under "branch" and choosing your preferred branch <br>
  8. When you've finalized the task, you can merge the branch to the main by dragging and dropping.
